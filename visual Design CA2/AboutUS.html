            <h2 >Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                Founded in 2016 by 5 local friends that had great taste for coffee, Urban Brews began as a small, community-oriented café. What started as a big dream has since grown into a beloved spot in the hearth of Dublin city. We strongly believe that coffee is more than just a drink it's a way to connect with others, share stories, have laughs and build memories. Over the years, we’ve expanded our bussiness but our commitment to quality and community remains the same at the heart of everything we do.
